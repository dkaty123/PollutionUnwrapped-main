# PollutionUnwrapped

The idea for this Dash app, which visualizes global plastic pollution, stems from my time as a Marine Plastic Ambassador at EarthEcho International. During this experience, I gained firsthand insights into the alarming scale of plastic pollution and its devastating impacts on marine ecosystems. I wanted to create a tool that not only raises awareness but also provides an interactive and data-driven way for users to understand the global distribution and severity of this crisis. This app is my attempt to merge environmental advocacy with technology to inspire action.
